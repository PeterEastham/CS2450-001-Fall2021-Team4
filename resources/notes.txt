Question for Shareholder,
Are all users employees of the company? If yes, should we allow employees to be
basic access? Psuedo code is something like.

if emp_id != ExistingUser_id[]:
  new_user = UC.make_employee_user(emp_id)
  UserRepo.save(new_user)

And then the user save format would swap to the following

username:password:permission1,permission2:employee_id

UC.make_employee_user(emp_id) would be something like the following.

newUser = User(username=emp.name, password=emp.id)
self.give_basic_permissions(newUser)
return newUser
