(Controllers)
IF I want employee information I ask the employee_controller, giving it an employee number.
  WHEN I ask for information, it searches the Repository for the employee.
  IF it can't find the employee, it gives me nothing.
  OTHERWISE I get the requested employee.

IF I have a new employee, I give it the employee_controller.
  THEN it verifies the employee has enough information.
  THEN it gives it to the repository to save.

IF I want payment information, I ask the payment_controller, giving it a specific employee.
  WHEN I ask the payment_controller, it goes to the employee_controller, receipt_controller, and timecard_controller. And get the required payment information.
  AFTER the payment_controller gets the information, it gives me back the expected pay for this pay cycle.

WHEN I ask receipt_controller for a receipt, I can ask for the receipt, or the total on the receipt.
  IF receipt_controller can't find the employee, it returns 0.

WHEN I ask timecard_controller for a TimeCard, I can ask for the TimeCard, or the total hours on that timecard.

IF I ask a controller for an item, if it doesn't have a repository open,
  THEN it gives me an error.

(Repositories)
WHEN I create a repository, I tell it where to find the information.
  WHEN it looks at the information, it assumes it is correct and formatted.

WHEN I ask for an id, we check an internal list.
  IF I can't find the id, I print to the console.
  OTHERWISE I return the object.


(Payment Handling | Midlevel~)
WHEN some asks for payment information, giving a specific employee id.
  THEN I check the CLASSIFICATION of the employee.
  IF the employee is COMMISSIONED.
    THEN I get the Receipt Totals and add the Salary.
  IF the employee is SALARIED.
    THEN I get the Salary.
  IF the employee is HOURLY.
    Then I get the total hours and times it by the HOURLY RATE.

  THEN I return the total income for that period.

IF someone asks for a payment string, giving a specific employee id.
  I ask MYSELF for the income.
  THEN I check the payment METHOD of the employee.
  IF the employee is DIRECT DEPOSIT
    THEN I get the bank information.
    THEN I put in the income.
    THEN I return the string.
  IF the employee is MAIL
    THEN I get the address information.
    THEN I put in the income.
    THEN I return the string.

(Prototype main.py in plain english)
WHEN I am run.
I get all the Employees.
I open a file.
THEN for each employee.
  I store their payment information.
THEN I write it to the file.
THEN I close.
