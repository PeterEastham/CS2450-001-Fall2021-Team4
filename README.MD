# CS2450-001-Fall2021-Team2
 Repository for Team 2 Now. Primarily code, and its associated documentation. Repository name will not be changed, as I cannot be bothered to.

# How to Run
  Open the CS2450-001-Fall2021-Team2 folder anywhere you want! Double click `main.py` to run.

  Do not click on `main_test.py` to run! This currently exists for testing purposes,
  and will be removed in the Submission for Sprint 6.

# Installation Issue
  This project is designed to run on Python 3.9.X, which you can find [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)
  You will know this is an issue if when you try to run the program, you get
  `|= is an unsupported operand for 'dict' and 'dict'`

  No other installation issues are currently known.

  You can check your version of Python by opening a Computer Shell and running
  `python --version`, for some versions of Windows that also might include
  `python3 --version`.

  For importing into your favorite IDE, follow the proper instructions for project
  importing, and make sure the Python Version for the Project is set for 3.9.X

# Coding Design
  Code is done in Python, following the PEP-8 standard, and uses the
  [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
   design pattern. It is important to note that models are simply the objects.
   The controllers will handle all our "Repositories" which we've separated for
   easier designing.
